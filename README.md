To help analyze the spread and evolution of the virus, this repo collated and analyzed data related to the viral genome, its variations, and locations in time and space from GISAID and GenBank. Information from the Wikipedia web page and published research papers were categorized and mined to extract epidemiological data, which was then integrated with the public dataset. Genomic and epidemiological data were matched with public information, and the data quality was verified by manual curation.
